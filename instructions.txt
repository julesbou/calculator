Create a calculator in HTML / CSS.

Open index.html in your browser, and start creating a calculator, you have one hour.

Rules:
- you need to use pure Javascript or jQuery (any other library is forbidden).
- put your css in style.css, final design is not important, but it needs to look at the very least decent.

See calculator.png to have an idea of functionalities needed, some important notes:
- "+/-" button is inversing the sign of the value displayed, so if you have "3" and click on it, you will see "-3".
- "%" button is dividing the value displayed by 100.
- "AC" button is reseting the value displayed.

Good hacking !
